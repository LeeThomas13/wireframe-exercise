# wireframe-exercise

## I will be trying to replicate a wireframe from a provided example.

I got my css reset from https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/

I got all my placeholder images from https://picsum.photos/ all photo credit goes to them. 

I got my lorem ipsum text from https://www.lipsum.com/

I used https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp as a reference for my nav bar nesting, but did not copy and paste code.

I used https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans?query=sans&category=Sans+Serif&vfonly=true&sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Josefin+Sans as my font for the whole page.

I used this color finder to get the exact colors specified https://html-color-codes.info/colors-from-image/#

I used a couple css selectors from https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp

I used https://www.quackit.com/html/codes/html_scroll_box.cfm#:~:text=An%20HTML%20scroll%20box%20is,overflow%20property%20to%20the%20div. to figure out the scrolling text box.
